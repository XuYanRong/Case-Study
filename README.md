### Overview and Origin 
- Wealthsimple is one of Canada's leading robo-advisor and private companies that provide easily accessible personal investment management services [[1]](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/about/who-we-are). It was incorporated in April 2013 and launched the platform in June 2014 [[2]](https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/1348112D:CN). Initially, the company first opened an office in Toronto, Canada.
- The founder of Wealthsimple, Mickael Katchen (the current CEO), was inspired to develop an automated investing platform from building investment portfolios on an Excel spreadsheet [[3]](https://hardbacon.ca/en/investing/who-owns-wealthsimple-the-answer-may-surprise-you/). When he was introduced to his peers, they thought investing portfolios were complicated. Katchen and his co-founder, Brett Huneycutt(the current COO), started their company to eliminate complicated investments concerns. In 2015, the Power Corporation of Canada offered Wealthsimple the first funding of CA$30 million, and now, POW is holding 70% of Wealthsimple[[4]](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wealthsimple/company_financials). After nine rounds of funding, Wealthsimple received a total of CA$900 million to boost their new project developments. The company continues and is endeavored to bring smart financial services to everybody, "regardless of age, net worth, background, and education." [[5]](https://www.nextcanada.com/michael-katchen/) As the company's name implies, its goal is to get people to grow their wealth most simply and thus achieve "financial freedom."
- To be distinguished from the rest of the competitors, Wealthsimple offers accounts in multiple countries, mainly in Canada, the U.S., and U.K. The closest match competitor is the American company, Betterment. It has slightly cheaper fees regarding investment advisory services, but the two companies are pretty similar in almost every category. [[6]](https://www.investopedia.com/wealthsimple-vs-betterment-4694293)
### Business Activities
- Before technologies prevailed in the financial world, traditional investing tended to be relatively complicated for those not working in the financial industry. It took time, money, and required clear minds to make the right decision to earn the return from investments. According to Katchen, traditional investing services scared people to pay more money for management and not get the right advice they needed [[7]](https://www.thelavinagency.com/speakers/michael-katchen). Therefore, the company tries to help everyone create a quickly diversified portfolio by low-cost index funds and earn the best possible return using robotic technologies. So that people could save more time and money to turn their investments into steady earnings. New technologies seem to be more attractive to young people. Thus, the intended customers for Wealthsimple are the millennials. Wealthsimple's platform is designed engaging, people-orientated, and high narrative content with powerful visuals to resonate with the mass millennials market [[8]](https://www.fintechmarketinghub.com/post/wealthsimple-how-to-resonate-with-your-target-audience). By targeting millennials, Wealthsimple is likely to grow much faster in the coming years. Forbes Magazine stresses that technologies made young people more interested in building long-term wealth. It is also evident in a 2020 global survey revealed that 75% of millennials are planning to invest even during the worldwide pandemic period [[9]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/03/17/why-young-people-should-be-investing-right-now/?sh=224a7795763e). 
- Similar to most robo-advisor companies, Wealthsimple utilises technologies to create a smart investing advisor. The platform Stackshare [[10]](https://stackshare.io/wealthsimple/wealthsimple) indicates that the company stores its data on third-party platforms such as PostgreSQL, Google Drive, Redis, Amazon clouds. Wealthsimple collects data, including account information, balance, transaction history, and personal information. Then, data scientists will build a state-of-the-art data warehouse that powers all investor decision-making [[11]](https://outerjoin.us/remote-jobs/senior-data-scientist-growth-algorithms-at-wealthsimple). Moreover, Wealthsimple uses different algorithms languages, from medium to high-level languages. For example, Java Program and Ruby. The purpose of using other languages is to understand and predict investors' preferences, risks and goals. More interestingly, to increase the company's ability to deliver high-quality services, DevOps integrate and automate the processes between software developers and IT teams [12]](https://startup.jobs/director-of-devops-and-cloud-infrastructure-wealthsimple-647254). For instance, Wealthsimple uses GitHub (which enables collaboration, review, and code management); Ansible (a tool for configuration management); and Docker (for monitoring and containerisation) [[13]](https://www.cuelogic.com/blog/what-is-devops). 

### Landscape
- The company is in the domain of personal finance service of the financial industry. It is a domain that covers personal managing money and saving and investing [[14]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personalfinance.asp). In the past decade, personal finance services have become technology-oriented. Online banking for saving money is now the Neobank which is more nimble and transparent than some megabank counterparts [[15]](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/what-is-a-neobank/). The traditional personal investing in stocks is converted to online mobile platforms for people to buy or sell their stocks more efficiently. Furthermore, the emerging area of investing in cryptocurrencies is more popular with young people now, and some companies innovated AI-powered supporting management on cryptocurrency. The future of this domain will aim to achieve more accurate and efficient services and thus, maximise returns and minimise risks. 
 
### Results
According to Wealthsimple's monthly blog, their business impact so far is the uncertainty of the global economy caused by the COVID-19 pandemic [[16]](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/message-from-our-founder). However, the top managers of Wealthsimple said that such uncertainty and surprises are under expectations which they will consider thoroughly in investment building processes. To measure the success of Wealthsimple, the company can use the valuation method to compare with other private financial service companies. Early in 2021, Wealthsimple received its 9th funding round with a post-money valuation of $4 billion [[17]](https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/wealthsimple-raises-610m-at-a-4b-valuation/). Such a high valuation indicates a leading company for a private company.

### Recommendations
As the primary business for Wealthsimple is servicing, customer services are crucial. Despite the standard office hours for all offices, they do not have 24-hour customer service. Suppose the company could offer a chatbot that creates problems solving and educational purposes. The chatbot could be attractive in its character (like a pet or a mascot) and AI-powered. Once they have opened their account for investments, it will be available for the clients. If the client has an emergency question, he could go to the chatbot first, which could help the client to solve some standard questions. Also, to expand the client's knowledge, the chatbot could help the client understand financial terminologies or the meaning of a particular index. 24-hour customer service could potentially build up a stronger relationship between the client and Wealthsimple, and by teaching them some finance-related knowledge, they might feel more confident in the company. To achieve this service chatbot, the company would be encouraged to use artificial intelligence. The technology can effectively answer any relevant questions friendly and relatively sentimental.
